Happy New Year [NAME]!

I hope you enjoyed Tankmas this
year. I delivered a few things
for you to enjoy, including some
songs in the Cafe Jukebox and
more art in the Town Hall.

There's one more gift arriving
later on, one last story to tell.
I hope you stick around for it,
and I hope you have a great year!

Here's to 2022,
-Tom
